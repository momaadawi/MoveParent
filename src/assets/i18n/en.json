Our smart Move Parent apps can help you get real-time updates about the children and school bus by monitoring the daily bus trips of your children and getting notified via push notifications. The app will keep you alerted when the bus is on the way to pick up your children, when the bus arrives to the pickup location and waiting for student onboarding and when the bus arrives to the school and your children get out of the bus. Moreover,  you can notify the school authorities of any absent plans for your child through the app and call the driver and supervisor of the bus."
